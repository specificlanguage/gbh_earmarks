    "# Keyword & Category Matching\n",
    "The following cells below are all keywords to identify category matching. While there's a good list of keywords that will easily match below, I just wanted to give a quick rationale/things that you might find in these categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Categories\n",
    "#### Essentials\n",
    "- Health: Anything relating to COVID-19, healthcare, or protection related to COVID-19, like HVAC installation and testing.\n",
    "- Housing: All projects related to affordable housing, or other initiatives related to housing\n",
    "- Food: All projects related to food pantries or access to food\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Non-Essentials\n",
    "While the overarching category is non-essentials, they are more broader categories that should not necessarily have direct impacts from the pandemic; mostly these are initiatives for public services unrelated to the above\n",
    "- Arts: Mostly theater and stage productions, or other cultural initiatives. Includes Museums, Theaters, etc.\n",
    "- Construction: Any project related to construction\n",
    "- Economic: Business, commerce, or other economic incentives\n",
    "- Education: Anything related to Primary/Secondary education, or libraries\n",
    "- Environment: Many projects in these earmarks correlate to rehabilitation of beaches, or improvement of water or sewage networks.\n",
    "- Essential Services: Ironically, these are closer to improvements towards fire/police stations, not necessarily funding for them\n",
    "- Equality: Most projects that are geared towards minority groups or societies. Also includes advocacy groups and initiatives designed to bring up veterans.\n",
    "- Events: Things related to one-time events like parades, new years parties\n",
    "- Historical: You'd be surprised how many there are with just one keyword\n",
    "- Human Services: Any project relating to family, youth, teen, or public safety development.\n",
    "- Mental Health: Anything related to behavioral health\n",
    "- Occupational: Projects relating to job training or initiatives to help people find work\n",
    "- Recreation: Projects relating to recreational facilities such as parks, sports centers, and even sidewalks\n",
    "- Rehabilitation: Anything related to drug rehabilitation\n",
    "- Religious: Anything related to church or religious\n",
    "- Transport: All projects relating to transport. Keywords omit \"rail\" as many could be projects for rail trails.\n",
    "- Technology: Many projects in earmarks are related to upgrading facilities with new technology\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Accessibility, Maintenance and Research\n",
    "I've specifically separated these three as they're more broad reaching categories that could fit in any of the above. But these are really just improvements or studies.\n",
    "- Accessibility: Any project relating to improving the quality of life for handicap people\n",
    "- Maintenance: Any project relating to literally repairing, replacing, upgrading, restoring, improving, rebuilding, etc.\n",
